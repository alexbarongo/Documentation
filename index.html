          In 2000 a Swiss foundation launched a campaign to determine the New
          Seven Wonders of the World. Given that the original Seven Wonders 
          list was compiled in the 2nd century BCE—and that only one entrant 
          is still standing (the Pyramids of Giza)—it seemed time for an 
          update. And people around the world apparently agreed, as more than 
          100 million votes were cast on the Internet or by text messaging. 
          The final results were announced in 2007.

          Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest 
          building-construction projects. Work began in the 7th century BCE 
          and continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the 
          structure actually features two parallel walls for lengthy 
          stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. 
          One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its 
          effectiveness.

           Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, 
          the wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, 
          scholars have noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”

          Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, 
          which flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan 
          tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of 
          important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable 
          is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”). A testament to 
          the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a total 
          of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the 
          spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the 
          pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent slithering down the 
          north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head.

          Life there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is 
          home to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the 
          Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball game 
          popular throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

          The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, 
          nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be 
          one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. 
          Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and 
          during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, 
          especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled 
          dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed 
          color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water 
          system that allowed for lush gardens and farming.

          A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and after 
          another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although 
          rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until 
          the late 20th century, and many questions remain about the city.

          This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram 
          Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold 
          used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. 
          Although that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu 
          has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the 
          “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of 
          chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while 
          some believe it was a royal retreat. (One thing it apparently should 
          not be is the site of a beer commercial.

          What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major 
          pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact. Despite its relative 
          isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it features agricultural 
          terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.

          Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount 
          Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World 
          War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They 
          proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva 
          Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 
          and was completed five years later. It is the largest Art Deco 
          sculpture in the world. Christ the Redeemer is made of reinforced 
          concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles.

          Somewhat disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by 
          lightning, and in 2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb was damaged

        <p class="words">
          The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the 
          Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 
          620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of 
          vaults. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, 
          though men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was 
          sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. 
          However, the belief that Christians were martyred there—namely, by 
          being thrown to lions—is debated.

          According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the 
          Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured and then 
          killed there that certain species reportedly became extinct.

          This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the 
          world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of 
          Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 
          1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”),
           who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 
           years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes 
           an immense garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of 
           white marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and 
           floral patterns.

          Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes. 
          According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own 
          mausoleum made out of black marble. However, he was deposed by one 
          of his sons before any work began.
